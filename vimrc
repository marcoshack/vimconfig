" have syntax highlighting in terminals which can display colours:
if has('syntax') && (&t_Co > 2)
  syntax on
endif

" have fifty lines of command-line (etc) history:
set history=50

" display the current mode and partially-typed commands in the status line:
set showmode
set showcmd

" * Text Formatting -- General

" don't make it look like there are line breaks where there aren't:
set nowrap

" use indents of 4 spaces, and have them copied down lines:
set shiftwidth=4
set shiftround
set expandtab
set autoindent

set textwidth=80


" backspace
set backspace=eol,start,indent

" get rid of the default style of C comments, and define a style with two stars
" at the start of `middle' rows which (looks nicer and) avoids asterisks used
" for bullet lists being treated like C comments; then define a bullet list
" style for single stars (like already is for hyphens):
set comments-=s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/
set comments+=s:/*,mb:**,ex:*/
set comments+=fb:*

" treat lines starting with a quote mark as comments (for `Vim' files, such as
" this very one!), and colons as well so that reformatting usenet messages from
" `Tin' users works OK:
set comments+=b:\"
set comments+=n::


" * Text Formatting -- Specific File Formats

" enable filetype detection:
filetype on

" recognize anything in my .Postponed directory as a news article, and anything
" at all with a .txt extension as being human-language text [this clobbers the
" `help' filetype, but that doesn't seem to prevent help from working
" properly]:
augroup filetype
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead */.Postponed/* set filetype=mail
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.txt set filetype=human
augroup END

" in human-language files, automatically format everything at 72 chars:
autocmd FileType mail,human set formatoptions+=t textwidth=72

" for C-like programming, have automatic indentation:
autocmd FileType c,cpp,slang set cindent

" for actual C (not C++) programming where comments have explicit end
" characters, if starting a new line in the middle of a comment automatically
" insert the comment leader characters:
autocmd FileType c set formatoptions+=ro

" for Perl programming, have things in braces indenting themselves:
autocmd FileType perl set smartindent

" for CSS, also have things in braces indented:
autocmd FileType css set smartindent

" for HTML, generally format text, but if a long line has been created leave it
" alone when editing:
autocmd FileType html set formatoptions+=tl

" for both CSS and HTML, use genuine tab characters for indentation, to make
" files a few bytes smaller:
autocmd FileType html,css set noexpandtab tabstop=2

" in makefiles, don't expand tabs to spaces, since actual tab characters are
" needed, and have indentation at 8 chars to be sure that all indents are tabs
" (despite the mappings later):
autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab shiftwidth=8

" make searches case-insensitive, unless they contain upper-case letters:
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" show the `best match so far' as search strings are typed:
" set incsearch

" assume the /g flag on :s substitutions to replace all matches in a line:
"set gdefault

set guifont=Monospace\ 9
